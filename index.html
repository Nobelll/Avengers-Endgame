    <p> <i>The film was announced in October 2014</i> as Avengers: Infinity War â€“ Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films.<i> Filming began in August 2017</i> at <u>Pinewood Atlanta Studios</u> in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the <u>Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas</u>, <u>New York state</u>, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.
